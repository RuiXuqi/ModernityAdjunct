This resource pack contains backports, adaptations, and sometimes constructions of textures or styles from more modern versions of many popular mods.

This pack is intended to supplement the [Modernity resource pack](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/modernity), which backports vanilla textures, so that things like nether ores will be textured appropriately alongside the official updated Netherrack texture.

 

I won't be adding wholesale support for additional mods. If you want inclusion of more textures, please gather/create the updated textures to me either here in a DM, or on my [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ysKmmqe). Please tell me which Minecraft version the textures are for, and make sure you have rights to distribute them.
